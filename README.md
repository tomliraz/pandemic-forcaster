PF is a software based model designed to predict the progression and outcomes of a pandemic spread. It assumes a city with 100,000 inhabitants, a time frame of 180 days, and considers 3 types of infection sites: residential, work, and recreational.
## Program Highlights
* Programmed in C++ and uses the unordered map data structure.
* Uses a custom algorithm that analyzes the input data and identifies how the pandemic will spread.
* Features an animated graph visualizing the predicted progression of the pandemic by uninfected, infected, recovered, and deaths.
* Features a heatmap showing the relative rate of infections originating at 3 types of sites: residential, work, and recreational.
* Required Input: R0 value (indicating Contagiousness), infection period, and mortality rate.
* Output: the predicted number of uninfected, infected, recovered, and deaths. Average number of infections caused at each site: residential, work, and recreational.
